'SafeRide' is a project meant to utilize the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission's geospatial database of regional bicycle lanes which analyzes the connectivity of the islands of networks, also based upon stress levels and for bikers. The main goal of the characterization is to determine where the bike network should be improved, extended and made safer. My idea however, is that this database has immediate utility for existing bikers and not just urban planners. The information about stressful bike lanes can help individual bikers plan out routes that optimize their riding experience much like a 'walkscore' approach. Bicycle injuries are often underreported in traffic injury reports but using the lowest levels of stressful routes can be fed into a directions API as a cost and weigh/bias the route to provide alternative biking routes whose legs are composed of more low level stress lanes than the standard. Typically, cycling profiles on Directions APIs from Google consider efficiency, number of turns and the travelling salesman problem of getting from point A to B in the short timeframe possible.
The Mapbox Directions API claims that their bike routing profile considers safety and roads with higher "bikeability" but the information from within the LTS analysis would nuance the Directions API if there exists a means of feeding input into it.
